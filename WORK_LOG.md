| Jan 7  | 11:00am - 11:30am |                                                                                                                        During this class period I had some initial thoughts about the project and looked through my test. On my test my approach had been to go through each spot in the board until you find the starting letter of the current word you are searching for, then you would BFS to success or failure to see if you got a match. And while this would be simple to code and would thoroughly work I'm not convinced that its the most efficient approach to this problem. |
| Jan 7  | 11:30am - 11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                   During this session of the class I ended up talking with my peers about solutions. One idea was to generate permutations of the board and store them and then to hash the board in some way such that you could hash each word and try to rabin-karp fingerprint search for a match. However, after some discussion this was shown to be a pretty innapropriate aproach to the problem. |
| Jan 8  |  8:00pm - 8:20pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                           During this session I mostly brainstormed more solutions, one such idea I had was to utilize a trie (or tst), but most likely a trie, to store the dictionary then to BFS from different starting points in the board and check the TST or trie each time. This has many unnecessary tricks inherently but if optimized / thought about more could be made much more efficient. |
| Jan 9  |  8:45am - 9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   During this session we learnt about the theory behind the problem set: using a recursive DFS approach to the problem to avoid issues of remembering board states and of going to visited squares. I began to code this approach and copied in my trie from spell check. |

I finished my code and met with Mr. Blick to discuss why I have having a null pointer error and realized it was the simple issue of not initializing my trie with words. |
| Jan 13 | 9:30pm - 10:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I traced my code with the simple small example to see why I wasn't passing all my checks. Two things became apparent from this testing: one, was I wasn't checking for duplicates, and second is I seemed to be skipping spaces in the board while searching. |
| Jan 13 | 10:00pm - 10:30pm | Now seeing these issues I rectified them. First, to fix the duplicates issue I used a HashSet instead of an ArrayList as it inherently doesn't store duplicates (the .add function will only add an element if its hash does not already exist). This solved the duplicate issue, then to solve the skipping board squares issue I looked through my nested for loop and saw I was incrementing i instead of j. Lastly, I changed the trie code slightly to use 26 characters instead of extended ascii which actually improved my codes runtime by around 0.2 seconds (huge difference)! |
